# CBP Wait Times: Browser Automation for Travel Logistics

## Sub-Heading (H2)

| Table   | Header |   Item |
| :------ | :----: | -----: |
| Abcdedf | QWERty | 123456 |
| asdf    |   e    |    321 |

The first row of the table becomes a `<thead>` with `<th>`'s.

The second row denotes `text-align:` of `right`, `left`, or `center`.

---

### Sub-Sub Heading (H3)

Some **bold** and _italic_ text or **_both_**. And [a link](https://google.com) to a site.

Having two returns after a line will wrap it in a `<p>` tag.  
But ending a line with two spaces will just place a `<br>`.

---

#### Sub-Sub Sub-Heading (H4)

1. Numbered
1. Lists
1. aadf
1. asdf

- Bulleted
  - Lists
  - rewq
- qwer

---

Wrapping text in a single set of `graves` will create an inline `<code>` tag.

---

Some markdown interpretters use 4 spaces to denote a code block (like Codepen and Reddit).

    <html>
        <div></div>
    </html>

---

Some markdown interpreters use 3 graves to denote a code block, followed by an optional filetype for syntax highlighting (**Codepen doesn't**, but Discord, Gitter, and GitHub do).

    ```js

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
console.log(i);
}

```

Most mark down interpreters will convert all of the following to an `<hr>`.

    ____________________

However, some (like HarooPad), will give special classes to the `<hr>` depending on the type of symbol you use to create different types of horizontal rules.
